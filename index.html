    <p>pen index.html in your text editor. Add a doctype tag at the top of the file indicating that the rest of the file will be HTML code. Then create opening and closing html tags to enclose the remainder of your page's content. Add opening and closing head and body tags within the outer html tags to break your HTML document up into two sections. Remember, the head section generally contains data intended for the web browser, and the body section contains the content our users will see and interact with on the page.</p>
